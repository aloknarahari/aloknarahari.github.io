<p><em> Economics, Junior</em></p>
<p> My name is Alok (pronounced uh-LOAK) and I'm an aspiring legal student. I currently work as a news reporter for the Daily Californian and recently co-founded 180 Degrees Consulting, an international pro-bono consultancy, here at Berkeley. Born and raised in Massachusetts (before moving to Fresno 5 years ago), I am an ardent Boston Sports fan. Yes, that means the Patriots, Red Sox, and Celtics. And yes, it means I have very few allies in the world of sports fandom. However, that only instills a higher level of support for my teams who I follow not only on the surface, but also through advanced stats and purportedly professional analysis. </p>
